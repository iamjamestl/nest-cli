# Nest CLI

This is a collection of commands written in Ruby to install, update, and
generally administer the Nest distribution.

## Installation

[Puppet](https://gitlab.james.tl/nest/puppet/-/blob/main/manifests/base/cli.pp)
ensures the latest `app-admin/nest-cli` package from the [Nest
overlay](https://gitlab.james.tl/nest/overlay/-/tree/main/app-admin/nest-cli)
is installed.

## Usage

All commands provided by this program can be accessed by running `nest`. There
are subcommands to manage ZFS boot environments, install new hosts, update
existing hosts, and reset them back to the desired state.

| Commands                | Description                  |
|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| `nest beadm SUBCOMMAND` | Manage ZFS boot environments |
| `nest install NAME`     | Install a new host           |

### Boot Environments

`nest beadm` provides subcommands to create, destroy, mount, unmount, activate,
and query ZFS boot environments, which are clones of the OS filesystems
inspired by [the same concept in Solaris
11](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E53394_01/html/E54749/aboutbes.html).  Boot
environments are used by the Nest installer to perform A/B seamless system
updates [similar to Android](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/ota/ab).

| Commands                     | Description                                                  |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `nest beadm activate [NAME]` | Configure and enable a boot environment for mounting at boot |
| `nest beadm create NAME`     | Clone the current boot environment to a new one              |
| `nest beadm destroy NAME`    | Delete the specified boot environment                        |
| `nest beadm list`            | Print the names of all boot environments                     |
| `nest beadm mount NAME`      | Mount a boot environment under /mnt                          |
| `nest beadm unmount NAME`    | Unmount a boot environment under /mnt                        |
| `nest beadm status`          | Display the current and active boot environments             |

All of these commands accept a `--dry-run` argument to only print the changes
that would be made.

## Development

This program is developed with Bundler. Initialize the project with `bundle
install`, then make changes to code under the `lib` directory. Check the code
with `bundle exec rake` and run the CLI with `bundle exec bin/nest`.

Prepare for release by bumping `VERSION` in `lib/nest/version.rb` and create a
new Git tag followed by a [new GitLab
release](https://gitlab.james.tl/nest/cli/-/releases/new).
